# Contributions
Okay, this is just me trying to be different from readme :P  
Have a table of contents! :boom:  
1. How do contribute?  
1. Contribution Rules
  
## How to contribute

1. Go to your repository _on github_  
1. Click Pull Requests  
1. Click "New Pull Request"  
1. Click "Create Pull Request"
1. Title your PR appropriately (rules)  
1. Basically fill in the blanks, delete the unnecessary stuff  
1. Click "Create Pull Request"  
1. You're done!  
  
## Contribution Rules
#### To make sure everyone's being nice, programmers are ***REQUIRED*** to post ALL updates (commits) to their own branch, labeled (your username/real.name)-update, unless you're in a Teletype Portal, Atom users. (Jaideeeeeeeeeeeeeen!)
#### The person posting the updates must add everyone else as contributors to the commit.
#### When posting a pull request to send your updates (try doing it at the end of each meet, at least), please label it based on what it's about. For example, if [@TheFinalDawn](https://github.com/TheFinalDawn) were to fix a turning bug that caused the robot to turn forever, he would label the pull request "Fix infinite turning bug" and add the [bug](https://github.com/Kalles-Robotics-Club/kalles-robotics/labels/bug) label to the request.
#### It is preferred you use Teletype when programming. (this is an add on for Atom, you can request it be set up.)
#### Please contact your head programmer for help with GitHub-related issues.
